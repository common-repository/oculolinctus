Show appreciation by licking adorable cats!

== Description ==

**Update**

In version 2, I have added meowing sound as well as option to configure the cat licking to before and/or after the content. As well as which post type it will be available to show on.
Configuration is available in Settings -> General. See screenshot for more info.

Very simple plugin, no setup required. Just install and have people show support by licking adorable cats!

Comes with a nice widget to display the most popular posts as well :)
